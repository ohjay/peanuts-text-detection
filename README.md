# Peanuts Text Detection
Made for the folks over at /r/peanuts and [peanuts-search](https://github.com/anjum-ahmed/peanuts-search), who are building a searchable Peanuts archive and who (as of May 31, 2016) seem to be transcribing all of the strips by hand. Just thought that this would speed up the workflow! :)

## Troubleshooting
If running the code throws the error `oauth2client.client.HttpAccessTokenRefreshError: invalid_grant: Bad Request`, try re-downloading the credentials at https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=[YOUR-PROJECT-HERE].
