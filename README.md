# Text Detection for Peanuts Comic Strips
Made for the folks over at /r/peanuts and [peanuts-search](https://github.com/anjum-ahmed/peanuts-search), who are building a searchable Peanuts archive and who (as of May 31, 2016) seem to be transcribing all of the strips by hand. Just thought that this would speed up the workflow! :)
